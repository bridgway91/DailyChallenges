// The aim of the kata is to try to show how difficult it can be to calculate decimals of an irrational number with a certain precision. We have chosen to get a few decimals of the number "pi" using the following infinite series (Leibniz 1646â€“1716):

// PI / 4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ... which gives an approximation of PI / 4.

// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80

// To have a measure of the difficulty we will count how many iterations are needed to calculate PI with a given precision of epsilon.
// There are several ways to determine the precision of the calculus but to keep things easy we will calculate PI within epsilon of your language Math::PI constant.
// In other words, given as input a precision of epsilon we will stop the iterative process when the absolute value of the difference between our calculation using the Leibniz series and the Math::PI constant of your language is less than epsilon.

// Your function returns an array or a string or a tuple depending on the language (See sample tests) with
// your number of iterations
// your approximation of PI with 10 decimals

// Example :
// Given epsilon = 0.001 your function gets an approximation of 3.140592653839794 for PI at the end of 1000 iterations : since you are within epsilon of Math::PI you return
// iter_pi(0.001) --> [1000, 3.1405926538]

// Notes :
// Unfortunately, this series converges too slowly to be useful, as it takes over 300 terms to obtain a 2 decimal place precision. To obtain 100 decimal places of PI, it was calculated that one would need to use at least 10^50 terms of this expansion!


function iterPi(epsilon) { // curious to see likely slimmer methods to get this
    let fourth = 1
    let iters = 1
    let i = 3
    let add = false
    while(Math.abs(Math.PI - 4 * fourth) > epsilon) {
        fourth += add ? (1/i) : -(1/i)
        iters++
        i = i + 2
        add = add ? false : true
    }
    console.log(`final:${epsilon},${iters},${4*fourth}`)
    return [iters,Math.round(4*fourth*Math.pow(10,10))/Math.pow(10,10)]
}


// alternatively...


function iterPi(epsilon) { // wow, much cleaner, sequence function nicely cleaned up (cool to see for loop be set up like a while loop, but that couldve been simply adjusted by having final 'i' in function iterate itself)
    let [res, i]= [0, 0];
    for (; Math.abs( Math.PI/4-res) > epsilon/4; i++)
        res +=  (i%2 ? -1 : 1) / (1 + 2*i)  ; 
    return [i, +(res*4).toFixed(10)]; // maybe this is why my original .toFixed() didnt work?
